# Accurate-Cyber-Defense-DNS-Traffic-Generator


Accurate-Cyber-Defense-DNS-Traffic-Generator is a cutting-edge cybersecurity tool engineered to simulate, analyze, and stress-test DNS infrastructure in controlled environments. 
It generates realistic DNS query traffic—both benign and malicious—to help security professionals evaluate the resilience, detection capabilities, and performance of DNS servers, 
firewalls, and monitoring systems.

This tool is ideal for:

DNS performance benchmarking

DNS anomaly detection research

Cyber defense training and labs

Blue-team stress simulations

Testing DNS over UDP, TCP, DoH, and DoT

Analyzing resolver behavior under heavy load

By providing configurable traffic patterns, adjustable query volumes, randomized domain generation, and optional malicious-traffic modes, the generator enables an accurate and safe assessment of DNS security posture. Built for education, research, and defensive testing, it empowers teams to strengthen their DNS-layer cyber defense strategies.
